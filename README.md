# deep-learning

This repository contains a various assortment of Deep Learning networks that I've worked on recently. 
All the necessary datasets should be included!

The neural networks used are of various types; including, but not limited to:
- Feed-Forward 
- LSTM
- Convolutional
- Autoencoders (Deep + Convolutional)
